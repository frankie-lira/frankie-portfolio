        <p>
          I'm Francisco — a Product Manager focused on accessibility, inclusive design, and scalable tech. I started as an iOS dev,
          moved into accessibility engineering, and now lead strategy and compliance efforts at Adobe.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          I care about empowering all users, especially those historically excluded from digital experiences. Outside of work, you’ll
          find me hiking, cooking, or planning the next accessibility hackathon.
